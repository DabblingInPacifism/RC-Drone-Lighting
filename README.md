Hi there! This guide will attempt to get you through the process of adding addressable LED lighting to your RC projects. As i learn, the scope of this project will expand, but i will be initially focused on general information and lighting for 75mm racing whoops, specifically meeeting [UDL Igniter specs.](https://undergrounddroneleague.com/)

Many many many many thanks to Jan Jaap and his [FPV Remote Visualizer,](https://github.com/UAV-Painkillers/fpv-remote-visualizer) which is a modification to add customizable LED rings around the Jumper T20s gimbals, but it can be used as the basis for remotely controlling the LEDs via your own controller.

## Knowledge Prerequisites/Who is this for?

If you can build and program your own drone, you can probably get through this no problem. **You do not need to know how to code or anything about embedded systems to get sick ass custom lighting on your racing whoop.** Every bit of knowledge makes this process easier, but i hadn't coded with any seriousness since more or less highschool before doing this. The tools that are available today make a project like this possible without deep programming knowledge. I'm going to attempt to present this in a way that you can skip the technical section if you choose just to get the lighting up and running, but the technical section will be the most relevent bits of electronics, lighting, embeded systems and coding that got me from basically 0 foundational knowledge to messing with this stuff.

## Disclaimer!

I'm not in software development or tech, am a tradesman without a formal education, am doing this stuff alongside maintaining professional certifications, education, my family and... quite honestly, i don't even regard myself as particularly bright, so keep all that in mind when reading this. If i got something wrong, please correct me and i'll update the repo to reflect! I'm just a guy trying to make some cool stuff.

# Light up your Whoop
## General overview

We're going to be using an ATTiny85 microcontroller to drive two strips of WS2812B COB leds in a rotating rainbow pattern. We'll use ChatGPT to generate the code we need, program our chip and put everything together.

## What we'll need.

Parts:
- [2.7mm 5V COB LEDs WS2812B or similar](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/2-7mm-COB-LED-Strip-Ultra_1601423996981.html)
- [ATTiny85 MCU](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/ATTINY85-20PU-ATTINY85-Attiny85-Microcontroller-DIP8_11000018774516.html)
- [Tiny AVR Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/SparkFun-Tiny-AVR-Programmer/dp/B00B6KNJRY)
- [Gorilla Double Sided tape](https://gorillatough.com/product/gorilla-double-sided-tape/)
- Wire, soldering kit, heat shrink.

Software:
- [Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
- [Tiny AVR Programmer drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tiny-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/#automatic-install) (This page will also show you how to enable the ATTiny plugin in Arduino IDE.)

## Build your light strips and wiring harness

Figure out where on your drone you're going to mount the ATTiny85 and measure out your wires. Solder and heatwrap them so that we can test the chip after the next step.
  
## Programming the ATTiny85

Now that you've got everything together and your computer's properly setup we need to get the actual code that's going to run on the MCU. The MCU is basically a tiny computer that can loop like 8kb of C code, which is just enough for our purposes. As i mentioned, i'm not a proficient coder any more and i don't have the time to dedicate to it. AI LLM's have been a godsend here, and the example code in [rainbow.c](rainbow.c) was generated by DeepSeek for me using a prompt similar to:
  
> Hey there, i'm using Arduino IDE to program an ATTiny85 to control two banks of 20 LEDs each on the chip's 0 and 1 pins. I want to use the FastLED library, and i have WS2812B LED strips. Please code me a program that will scroll/rotate a rainbow pattern around the banks that pulsates in brightness, with a maximum of 75% brightness to conserve the power source's battery.

I put this prompt into ChatGPT using the 4o model and the resulting output functions appropriately, so pick your poison or dive in and tackle it on your own. [Scott Marley's FastLED Basics youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ut4UK7612M&t=579s&pp=ygURTEVEIGNvZGluZyBiYXNpY3M%3D) is an excellent starting point, although i have to warn you i was unprepared for how math-heavy patterning LEDs was. It makes sense when you think about it, waving patterns of lights are just mathmatical transformations to sin wave functions, but trying to figure out the formula i'd need made my head hurt.

Once you have your code, fire up Arduino IDE and create a new sketch. Paste your code and ensure that you board (ATTiny), processor (ATTiny85), and clock speed (8Mhz Internal) are all correct and that your programmer is set to USBtinyISP. Plug your MCU into the programmer making sure the notch in the chip is aligned with the diagram on the board and then plug the programmer into your computer. Hit upload, and if everything went smoothly congradulations! We're programmed! If not, take your error back to your LLM and work through it.

## Testing

We have to make sure everything works before we throw everything together. I highly reccomend buying a cheap electronics breadboard kit that comes with alligator clip to jumper connection wires, because they make it a breeze. ATTiny85 are DIP compatible so they can go over the ravine in a breadboard. You don't need to wire the entire circuit, you can test one strip at a time, but test both strips on both pins to make sure you have 100% functionality from both your LED strips, which tend to be more delicate than single colored COB strips, and your MCU. Run your LEDs and chip in parrallel off the power supply, and test it directly off a 1S battery.
